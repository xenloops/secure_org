# Maturing the Security Program

These are tasks that should be undertaken to reach the three maturity levels according to the [OWASP SAMM](https://owaspsamm.org). In fact, these are largely taken from the SAMM, rephrased from questions to statements.

# Governance

| 3 | Do you regularly review and update the Strategic Plan for Application Security? |
### Measure and Improve
| Level | Task |
|:--:|--|
| 1 | Do you use a set of metrics to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of the application security program across applications? |
| 2 | Did you define Key Performance Indicators (KPI) from available application security metrics? |
| 3 | Do you update the Application Security strategy and roadmap based on application security metrics and KPIs? |
## Policy and Compliance
### Policy and Standards
| Level | Task |
|:--:|--|
| 1 | Do you have and apply a common set of policies and standards throughout your organization? |
| 2 | Do you publish the organization's policies as test scripts or run-books for easy interpretation by development teams? |

### Compliance Management
| Level | Task |
|:--:|--|
| 1 | Do you have a complete picture of your external compliance obligations? |
| 2 | Do you have a standard set of security requirements and verification procedures addressing the organization's external compliance obligations? |

## Education and Guidance
### Training and Awareness
| Level | Task |
|:--:|--|
| 1 | Do you require employees involved with application development to take SDLC training? |
| 2 | Is training customized for individual roles such as developers, testers, or security champions? |
| 3 | Have you implemented a Learning Management System or equivalent to track employee training and certification processes? |
### Organization and Culture
| Level | Task |
|:--:|--|
| 1 | Have you identified a Security Champion for each development team? |
| 2 | Does the organization have a Secure Software Center of Excellence (SSCE)? |
| 3 | Is there a centralized portal where developers and application security professionals from different teams and business units are able to communicate and share information? |

# Design
## Threat Assessment
### Application Risk Profile
| Level | Task |
|:--:|--|
| 1 | Do you classify applications according to business risk based on a simple and predefined set of questions? |
| 2 | Do you use centralized and quantified application risk profiles to evaluate business risk? |
| 3 | Do you regularly review and update the risk profiles for your applications? |
### Threat Modeling
| Level | Task |
|:--:|--|
| 1 | Do you identify and manage architectural design flaws with threat modeling? |
| 2 | Do you use a standard methodology, aligned on your application risk levels? |
| 3 | Do you regularly review and update the threat modeling methodology for your applications? |
## Security Requirements
### Software Requirements
