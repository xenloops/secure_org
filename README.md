# Secure Organization Project
Practices to maintain that help secure an organization and reduce its risk exposure.

Technology plays a vital role in all aspects of our modern lives, so it's essential for organizations to prioritize lowering their technology risk. Cyber threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and the potential consequences of a cyber attack can be devastating. These consequences can include financial loss, legal liability, reputational damage, and disruption of operations.

To combat these threats, an organization must develop a robust and comprehensive security program that addresses its specific needs and risks. This program should be designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the organization's information and information systems.

Building a cybersecurity program requires a systematic approach that involves assessing risks, developing policies and procedures, implementing technical controls, and training employees. It should be a collaborative effort that involves stakeholders from different parts of the organization, including IT, legal, human resources, and senior management.

The purpose of this program is to establish a culture of security within the organization, where everyone is responsible for safeguarding information and systems. It's an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring and improvement to stay ahead of evolving threats.

This guide presents the key steps involved in building an effective cybersecurity program, including risk assessment, policy development, technical controls, and employee training. It also explores best practices and strategies for maintaining a strong security posture and responding to incidents.

As with all things security, this guide should be considered a work in progress. No security program is ever 100% complete, just as no security tool is 100% thorough.
