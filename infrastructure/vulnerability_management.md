# Things you never want to see in your VM tool output

Within the seemingly endless list of vulnerabilities and remediations that any vulnerability management (VM) tool will report, there are some things (aside from the highest-severity items of course) that love to hide deep down in the list that you will want to take care of reasonably quickly. Here is a list to search for in the findings, to get them on the radar sooner than a CVSS-sorted list will usually provide:

* **Keywords** -- when these appear in the list of findings, look into them.
  * "default" -- Default logins/passwords are publicly documented and have no place in production. Change is good.
  * "guest"  -- Same with guest logins. Get rid of them.
  * "password" -- Any time a VM tool bothers to include this word in its findings, it's not a good sign. Investigate.
  * "root" and "admin"/"administrator" -- Probably lead to a default login finding.
  * "SSL", "TLS", "3DES", "MD4", "MD5", "OpenSSL", "weak", etc. -- Usually mean there's something wrong with the encryption algorithms some assets use. Crypto must be kept up-to-date.
  * "Policy" -- Probably means some security policy is misconfigured.
  * "Invalid"
  * "Expired" 
* **Truly nasty exploits** -- these are things you absolutely do not want to happen:
  * "Remote Code Execution" -- the "My other computer is your Windows Server" vuln
  * "Elevation of Privilege" -- if anyone could pretend to be the CEO, you'd boot them, wouldn't you?
  * "Information Disclosure" -- you probably wouldn't want all those data on a billboard
  * "Denial of Service" or "DOS" -- when availability is important to an organization (but isn't that always?)
* **Insecure services** -- these might not be obsolete, but they are insecure in some way and should be replaced or a control put in place.
  * telnet -- sends credentials and other data without encryption.
  * rlogin -- sends credentials and other data without encryption. Replace with ssh.
  * ftp -- file and credential exchange without encryption. Use only for nonsensitive information or replace with another method, such as sftp.
  * gopher -- again, without encryption. Also more legacy than I'd care to admit. Use something else.
* **Obsolete software** -- you'd be surprised how much unsupported commercial software sits around, swarming with unpatched vulnerabilities. Some notable examples:
  * Microsoft Internet Explorer, EOL 15 June 2022
  * Microsoft Silverlight, EOL 12 Oct 2021
  * Adobe Flash Player, EOL 31 Dec 2020
  * Adobe Shockwave, EOL 9 April 2019
* **Network/security tools** -- there are many useful tools that network administrators, security engineers, and penetration testers have a legitimate business need to have. Any mention of the following tools should be investigated to ensure they are of current legitimate use, and were not just installed "for funzies" by curious employees:
  * Wireshark
  * nmap
  * Metasploit
  * Metasploitable (if this appears, get rid of it -- if your VM tool can see it, an attacker can too)
